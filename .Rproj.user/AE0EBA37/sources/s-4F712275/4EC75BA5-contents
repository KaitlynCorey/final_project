QUESTIONS
1. Do we need a section for loading the libraries, or are we just putting that in the READ ME ?
2. How do I cite this? https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/comparison-between-2016-2017-nsduh-state-prevalence-estimates
3. Do we need to do some sort of numerical analysis? Or is talking about the graphs enough?
